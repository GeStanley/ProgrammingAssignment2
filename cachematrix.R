## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## This function creates a vector containing functions to get and set the matrix as well as it's inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(solve) i <<- solve
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
  
}


## This function checks to see if the inverse of a matrix has been cached. 
## If it has it returns the cached inverse.
## If it has not, it calculates the inverse.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
